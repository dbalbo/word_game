Project Name
Synopsis

Word Game. Buildt By Debbie Balbo Crafted as part of the Spring 2015 Ruby course curriculum at Epicodus.

Motivation

This was for a code review.

The game is supposed to have a user input a sentence or a word, then go to another page where it would show the word or phrase in 'code' (which is merely the vowels replaced by a dash)
